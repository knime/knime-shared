 *  ECLIPSE with only the license terms in place for ECLIPSE applying to
 *  ECLIPSE and the GNU GPL Version 3 applying for KNIME, provided the
 *  license terms of ECLIPSE themselves allow for the respective use and
 *  propagation of ECLIPSE together with KNIME.
 *
 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
 *  NodeDialog, and NodeView) and that only interoperate with KNIME through

 *  Nodes are deemed to be separate and independent programs and to not be

 *  license Nodes under the License, and you are granted a license to

/**
 * Testing utilities for a proxy "environment", i.e. a test context. This package exists
 * because of the split between {@link org.knime.core.util.proxy.search.GlobalProxyStrategy}s
 * in pure Java-based strategies and OSGi-fied Eclipse-based strategies.
 * <p>
 * With the {@link org.knime.core.util.proxy.testing.ProxyParameterProvider}, tests can use
 * {@code @RegisterExtension} to register implementation of said parameter providers, and
 * subsequently test Java-based strategies where possible (currently knime-shared), as well
 * as test Eclipse-based strategies where possible (currently knime-core).
 * </p>
 * Further, this package provides accessors to Httpbin and Tinyproxy sidecars, and the
 * environment variables that they provide to the JVM.
